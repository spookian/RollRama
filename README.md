# RollRama

This is a work-in-progress romhack for Kirby's Return to Dreamland that aims to create an entirely new gamemode based off of the 2001 Game Boy Color game "Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble".

## FAQ

#### How do I help out with this project?
* Contact me on discord to start out, my tag is @shinton.
* I recommend being somewhat skilled in C++, C, or assembly. You can pick up the other two as long as you have one of the three down.
* Even if you don't have any experience with programming, I'd still like someone to help with getting the linker set up so I don't have to go on a massive detour every time I add extern code to the repository.

#### How are you decompiling class names?
* Check out this guide by Ninji, the lead developer of Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii. (https://wuffs.org/blog/reversing-games-with-hashcat)

#### What's the deadline?
* April 1st. This is going to be a public release.

## Roadmap
No work done on implementation just yet, I'm still doing research on the base game's code, but realistically implementation should start around mid-late January.
